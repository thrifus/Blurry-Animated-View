# Blurry-Animated-View
__Create a cool blurry animated view in Swift using a UIWebView, a GIF image, and a "Visual Effect View with Blur".__

_All the other stuff like UI elements (LOGIN, UITextFields, etc.) are all for show and don't need to be there for this example to work. They just make it look 100% cooler._
