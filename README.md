# Blurry-Animated-View
__Create a cool blurry animated view in Swift using a UIWebView, a GIF image, and a "Visual Effect View with Blur".__

_All the other stuff like UI elements (LOGIN, UITextFields, etc.) are all for show and don't need to be there for this example to work. They just make it look 100% cooler._

## Donations:
If you like my work, please consider donating. Since I'm a senior in high school and also working toward my Eagle Scout, I don't have time for a real job. Any donations would be greatly appreciated and would go towards buying better hardware, internet, etc.
